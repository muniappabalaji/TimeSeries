There were also the Sudanese civil and Gaza wars, which had escalated into a famine and humanitarian crisis. Internal crises in Armenia, Bangladesh, Ecuador, France, Georgia, Germany, Haiti, Somalia, and South Korea continued into this year, with the latter leading to President Yoon Suk Yeol's arrest and removal from office. Several brief conflicts out of longstanding tensions emerged mid-year—India–Pakistan in May, Iran–Israel in June, and Cambodia–Thailand in July, in which a leaked phone call involving Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Cambodian Hun Sen resulted in the removal of the former.\n",

The technology sector was additionally hit with the release of DeepSeek's chatbot, a Chinese large language model which competes with ChatGPT. Aviation and aerospace also saw accidents this year, including when Air India Flight 171 crashed in Ahmedabad, India. Several advances in space exploration were made as well, including the first crewed polar orbit spaceflight, and the first fully successful landing of a spacecraft on the Moon by a private company.\n",
